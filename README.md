## What is this book about?
Do you want to develop reliable and secure applications that stand out from the crowd without spending hours on boilerplate code? You’ve made the right choice trusting the Django framework, and this book will tell you why.

Web Development with Django will take you through all the essential concepts and help you explore its power to build real-world applications using Python.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Create a new application and add models to describe your data
* Use views and templates to control behavior and appearance
* Implement access control through authentication and permissions
* Develop practical web forms to add features such as file uploads
* Build a RESTful API and JavaScript code that communicates with it
* Connect to a database such as PostgreSQL
